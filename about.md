I took up programming at around the age of 8. Dad writes code too, he makes a living out of it. So do I. In the last 2 years I got a bit tired, so here I am to have some *fun* in the IT world again! I'm tired of people who are all about breaking rules, but forget to create new ones. In the last year I have been working with Scala and Akka...

Other then that, I live in London, frequently wandering in parks and pubs. I like soups and salmon, Sherlock and Game of Thrones, autobiographies.
