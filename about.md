A sometimes burnt out software engineer, climbing the career ladder, trying to get the fun put back into computing.

I took up programming at around the age of 8. Dad writes code too, he makes a living out of it. So do I. In the last 2 years I got a bit tired, so here I am to have some *fun* in the IT world again! I'm tired of people who are all about breaking rules, but forget to create new ones.

Other then that, I live in London, frequently wandering in parks and pubs. I like soups and salmon, Sherlock and Game of Thrones, autobiographies, and so on. I sometimes drink my tea with 2 sugars, milk.
